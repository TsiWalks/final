           <h2>How Can We Help</h2>
               <div class="faq">
                    <h3>Do you have accounts available for businesses and wholesalers?</h3>
                        <p class="hide">As the largest distributer of Duracell Bulk Batteries Australia we deal with all types of different companies, business and even supply many of the other Duracell distributors in Australia. Accounts are available upon application if you meet the standard criteria of purchases in excess of $1000 per month.</p>
                    <h3>Do you offer free shipping?</h3>
                        <p class="hide">To provide you with the most competitive pricing and service in Australia we do not offer free shipping to non account customer. We have some of the best freight rates in Australia and pass these prices on to you. If we were to offer free shipping we would have to work this into the price of the product and in the end 99% of our customers would end up paying more which would subsidize the 1% that are from far regional towns that are expensive to ship too. For account customers you may be eligible to FIS if you meet our minimum criteria.</p>
                    <h3>What is the return policy?</h3>
                        <p class="hide">Your personal satisfaction is guaranteed for all purchases. If you are dissatisfied with any of the products you purchased for any reason, Hollyhock Batteries will accept the merchandise for either a credit or exchange. If the product is being returned for credit, only the credit card used to purchase the item will be issued the credit. Returns for credit or exchange will be honored if:
                        Product(s) are returned within 30 days of receipt
                        The "Return" portion of the packing slip accompanies the shipment with reason for return noted.
                        Product is packed in original packaging
                        We regret that we will not be able to accept returns for cash or credit from a gift recipient. We will gladly exchange the item for an exact replacement, or a credit against the another item.
                        Shipping charges are not refundable, unless they are due to a shipping or processing error by Hollyhock Batteries. If Hollyhock Batteries is responsible for the error, the return shipping charges will be refunded to your credit card. If you received free shipping or the shipping costs were not fully covered by what you paid then the difference will be deducted from the amount of refund you are entitled too.</p>
                    <h3>What is the guarantee on an item?</h3>
                        <p class="hide">Each product comes with its own manufacturers guarantee. Please refer to the package or warranty card enclosed with the item you purchased.</p>
                    <h3>Can I cancel my order once I place it?</h3>
                        <p class="hide">You have the option of changing and canceling your order during the Checkout portion of the order process. If you wish to cancel your order you have placed, you may contact our Customer Service center by phone +61 3 9770 8235 Monday-Friday, 9am - 5pm Eastern Standard Time, to see if the order may be cancelled prior to shipping.
